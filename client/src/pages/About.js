                    Unforunately we live in a time where technology is heavily taken advantage of. It's ever improving speed is forcing us to adapt to a type of culture where we also want things fast, quick, and at whatever cost. Due to this, we have become a throw away culture. As soon as something breaks or stops working, we throw it away and buy something new. For this reason, came up with the idea for this eCommerce website.
